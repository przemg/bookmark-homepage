## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (with high polished, custom animations and transitions)
- Vanilia JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to build a carousel using as small an amount of js coda that I can, so I found interesting CSS property - scroll-snap-type. Example code below:

```css
carousel {
 ...
 ...
 ...

 &__wrapper {
    display: flex;
    flex: none;
    flex-flow: row nowrap;
    width: inherit;
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0 -24px;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
    overflow-x: auto;
    scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
    scroll-snap-stop: always;
    scrollbar-width: none;
    -ms-overflow-style: none;
    scroll-behavior: smooth;

    &::-webkit-scrollbar {
      display: none;
    }
  }

  &__item {
    flex: none;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    padding: 0;
    margin-right: 160px;
    scroll-snap-align: center;
    overflow: visible;
  }
}
```
